**1). Name two command from this course, briefly and give a describe why it's essential for each question.**
Ans: Two command chosen was 'cat' and 'cd' command, for the first command can use to open the context of that file we choose and also used for print2combine the content in reverse order,
like 'cat file1.txt file2.txt > file3.txt' even it's was the basic command but that was the one of quick and the easiest way to check and edit in file
And For 'cd' stand for change directory like its name to navigate amoung the directory. it's important cause it's useful command when you work in different directory and want to change, also can check the workflow.

**2). After one and a half years in the ISNE program, what advice would you give to prospective ISNE students?**
Ans: Because I'm just the freshmen student, so I can't told much but the advise I'll gave that base on my opion. 
Even this programme doesn't focus on math and physics like other engineering program, but you should know and remember you're highschool knowledge a bit, please don't be like me. 
And practise C++ before, it was the first language we start with. Focus on building practical skills along with the algorithm class, pretent to love coding so well ...then, Good luck!
